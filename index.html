            <h1>Where I Started</h1>

            <p>I have always loved computers and technology. When I was in college at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls, I started working as an IT helpdesk technician. This is where I discovered computer science and programming. I then enrolled in three computer science courses at the next opportunity. </p>

            <p>Coming into Capita3 Leader Launch, I already had this goal however I did not have any hard deadlines assocated with my milestones. Without deadlines, loose deadlines would come and go with little progress being made. I had completed a few computer programming online courses, made some computeter programs to automate different aspects of my job, and applied to some IT programming jobs.</p>

            <P>What I did not take into account was my mindset. Though I felt like the college and online courses that I had completed had prepared me to be job ready. I never felt like I was a programmer. I now understand that in order to feel like a programmer, I need to join programming commmunities. </P>

            <h1>Where I am Now</h1>
            <p>Since utilizing Capita3 materials, I have been able to update my long-term
                milestone plan with additional tasks to complete to address any knowledge gaps and combat the internal and external barriers that I face.
                I now see that I need to create a team of experts and cheerleaders to help me in accomplishing
                my goals within the timeframe that I set. 
            </p>

            <p>My leadership and how I view myself has also changed during my time in Leadership Launch. I am starting to fell like I can call myself a programmer. 
                This mindset will help greatly when interviewing, as I will be more confident in myself. I also have a well thought out plan with deadlines that I can execute. 
                Having this plan will help hold myself accountable to reach my goals by the deadline that I set for myself.

            <h1>What Made the Difference</h1>
            <p>The biggest difference in my growth as a leader came from facing my fears of joining a community and asking for help.
                I have always struggled to ask for help, but I now realize that in order to efficiely reach my goal, I will need people in my corner.
            </p>
            <p>My biggest "Aha" moment came from identifying internal barriers and recognizing that we develop
                strengths or "work arounds" to avoide facing these fears. I have always viewed these work arounds as just strengths
                but I now see that in order to be the leader that I want to be, I need to also address my concerns.
            </p>
            <p>The impact of facing my fears will allow me to gain a network of people to help me reach my goal in a timely manner.
                It will also help me identify the best plan and projects to create to give me the best chance at getting hired. 
            </p>
