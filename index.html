            <h1>Where I Started</h1>

            <p>I have always loved computers and technology. When I was in college at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls, I started working as an IT helpdesk technician. This is where I discovered computer science and programming. I then enrolled in three computer science courses at the next opportunity. </p>

                        <p>Coming into Capita3 Leader Launch, I already had this goal, however, I did not have any hard deadlines assocated with my milestones. Without deadlines, time would pass with little to no progress made.</p>

                            I now see that I need to create a team of experts and cheerleaders to help me in accomplishing

                            Having this plan will help hold myself accountable to reach my goals by the deadline that I set for myself.

                <summary>"Aha" Moment</summary>
                <p>My biggest "Aha" moment came from identifying internal barriers and recognizing that we develop
                    strengths or "work arounds" to avoide facing these fears. I have always viewed these work arounds as just strengths
                    but I now see that in order to be the leader that I want to be, I need to also address my concerns.

                    It will also help me identify the best plan and projects to create to give me the best chance at getting hired.
